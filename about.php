      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Spitfire Records! We are a New Zealand based online record store, shipping nationwide. We stock new
        and used Vinyl, CDs, Music DVDs and Cassettes across various genres&mdash;but specialise in Rock and Heavy
        Metal. We
        work hard to bring you titles you may not often see in New Zealand record stores. Everything you see on our site
        is in stock and ready to ship&mdash;no more frustrating waits for overseas packages!
      </p>
      <p>While we don&#39;t have a physical shop, if you are in the Waikato/Bay of Plenty and would like to pick up an
        order
        rather than pay for postage, we can arrange collection from the Matamata area free of charge&mdash;simply flick
        us an
        email under the contact us section or a send us a Facebook message.</p>
      <p>We also buy used collections, so if you have any old music sitting around that you wish to sell, please send us
        an email or Facebook message and we&#39;ll chat.</p>
